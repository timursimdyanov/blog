## About Me  

My name is Timyr Simdyanov. I am a first-year student at RUDN University majoring in Business Informatics. My studies combine economics and information technology, which allows me to gain a deeper understanding of digitalization processes in business.  

I aim to develop in the fields of data analysis, systems design, and IT project management. I believe it is essential to work at the intersection of technology and management, as this area forms the foundation for modern business models.  

In my free time, I am interested in sports, strategy-based board games, and learning foreign languages. These activities help me strengthen teamwork, analytical thinking, and communication skills.

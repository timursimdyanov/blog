## Weekly Summary  

The second week of August was dedicated to working with SQL. I practiced writing queries and analyzing small training datasets. This helped me better understand the connection between theoretical knowledge and its application in business analytics tasks. I also attended a lecture on the development of digital ecosystems, where the role of information systems integration in organizational management was discussed. In my free time, I continued sports activities and watched popular science materials.

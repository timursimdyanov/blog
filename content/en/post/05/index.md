## Weekly Summary  

The beginning of September was marked by active preparation for the new academic year. I organized my notes, reviewed study plans for upcoming subjects, and identified priority areas for development. My main focus was on the in-depth study of information systems, as they form the foundation of the Business Informatics program. In addition to academic activities, I took part in discussions of organizational matters with fellow students and began preparing for upcoming project assignments.

## Weekly Summary  

This week I focused on revising the fundamentals of business informatics and related disciplines. I dedicated time to systems analysis and explored examples of digital business transformation. In parallel, I began studying methods of working with databases, which will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of data storage and processing. For a change of pace, I visited the university library, where I found several valuable monographs on management and business process organization.

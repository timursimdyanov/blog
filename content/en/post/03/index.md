## Weekly Summary  

This week I devoted particular attention to the study of project management. I became familiar with the basic principles of Agile and examined how flexible methodologies are applied in modern business. My preparation included reading articles and analyzing practical examples of implementing digital tools in corporate environments. In addition, I started working on a small academic project that requires linking data analysis tasks with managerial decision-making.

## Weekly Summary  

This week was dedicated to developing analytical thinking and working with economic indicators. I studied the basics of financial analysis and compared them with the principles of business informatics. To reinforce the material, I completed several practical exercises related to data interpretation and forecasting. In the evenings, I read foreign articles to improve my knowledge of English terminology in the field of information technology.
